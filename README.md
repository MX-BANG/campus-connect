## 🎯 About the Project

**Campus Connect** is a student discovery platform that breaks the initial communication barrier many students face — especially introverts — by helping them learn basic, verified details about their peers: name, major, interests, and more.

Built with the mission to make real-life conversations easier on campus, this app creates a simple, non-intrusive, and verified way to explore your university community.
